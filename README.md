# air-travel-project
This project aims to forecast domestic air travel demand in the U.S., providing actionable insights to support strategic business decisions. Using unsupervised learning, traveler segmentation will be performed to identify key patterns in socio-demographic and behavioral data, followed by predictive modeling based on economic indicators and temporal factors to estimate future travel volume. By analyzing demand fluctuations and emerging trends, the project seeks to offer a robust framework for optimizing travel strategies and enhancing decision-making processes.
